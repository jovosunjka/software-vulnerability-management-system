## About The Project

**Software vulnerability management system** is a system that can analyze data flow diagrams (DFD) and find potential security exploits.
It decomposes the input diagram into risk patterns. Found risk patterns are then given to the rule-based engine which is consisted of the set of the rules.
Rules analyze components of the DFD in order to find vulnerabilities. 

Final report is given as a PDF document with:
- Date and time.
- Name of the file (DFD) that is being analyzed.
- List of patterns with all discovered exploits. For each exploit there is a detailed description as well as the recommended countermeasures.
- List of all discovered exploits on the complex process elements.
- List of publicly know vulnerabilities for the [Common Platform Enumerations](https://cpe.mitre.org/) (CPE) that are specified on the diagram elements.


This system is a Spring Boot-based project written in the Java programming language and created with Apache Maven.
Exploits of the system are defined in a separate [XML file](https://github.com/marija-kovacevic/software-vulnerability-management-system/blob/master/EDS-Solution-master/src/main/resources/diagrams/exploits_definitions.xml) that can easily be modified. 

The knowledge base of the system was implemented using [Drools](https://www.drools.org/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- [Installed Java 1.8](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- [Installed Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/marija-kovacevic/software-vulnerability-management-system
```
2. Open projects in IDEs:
   - **EDS-Solution-master** in Eclipse, Intellij or similar.
   - **ExploitsDetectionSystemClient-master** in Webstorm, Visual Studio Code, Atom or similar.

3. Build both projects (all libraries will be automatically downloaded)

4. Run both projects

5. Open your browser
```
http://localhost:4200
```

## Versioning
